Take a pic of yourself or someone else, the CoreML machine learning model will decide if you/they are good looking or not ;)

Something to have fun with!

Created using hundreds of images as training data from various parts of the Internet, CoreML model trained on macOS

Code by Jeff Yardley 2019 using a CoreML tutorial, but the CoreML model is custom made from manually curated data.
